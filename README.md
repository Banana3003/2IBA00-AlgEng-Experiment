# 2IBA00-AlgEng-Experiment

Under folder Dijkstra, we have implementation of basic dijkstra, dijkstra with min heap, dijkstra with pairing heap, dijkstra without priority queue, dial's algorithm, and their auxiliary heap classes. We also provide input file "flevoland.txt" as example data. We do not upload data for map of utrecht or noord brabant due to github only allowing 25MB files.
